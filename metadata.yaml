description: "The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a British children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter that follows mischievous and disobedient young Peter Rabbit\
  \ as he is chased about the garden of Mr. McGregor. He escapes and returns home\
  \ to his mother, who puts him to bed after dosing him with tea. The tale was written\
  \ for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore,\
  \ in 1893. It was revised and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several\
  \ publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by Frederick Warne\
  \ & Co. in 1902. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the\
  \ years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages,\
  \ and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the best-selling books of all time.\n\
  Since its release the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children\
  \ and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one\
  \ of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter\
  \ Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board\
  \ game.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
